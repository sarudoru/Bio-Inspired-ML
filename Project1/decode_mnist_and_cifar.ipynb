    "### General guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Never integrate extensions into your base project so that they change the expected behavior of core functions. If your extension changes the core design/behavior, no problem, duplicate your working base project and add features from there.\n",
    "2. Check the rubric to keep in mind how extensions on this project will be graded.\n",
    "3. While I may consult your code and \"written log\" of what you did, **I am grading your extensions based on what you present in your 3-5 min video.**\n",
    "3. I suggest documenting your explorations in a \"log\" or \"lab notebook\" style (i.e. documenting your thought/progression/discovery/learning process). I'm not grading your writing, so you can keep it succinct. **Whatever is most useful to you to remember what you did.** \n",
    "4. I suggest taking a hypothesis driven approach. For example \"I was curious about X so I explored Y. I found Z, which was not what I expected because..., so then tried A...\"\n",
    "5. Make plots to help showcase your results.\n",
    "6. **More is not necessarily better.** Generally, a small number of \"in-depth\" extensions count for more than many \"shallow\" extensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### AI guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "You may use AI in mostly any capacity for extensions. However, keep in mind:\n",
    "1. There is no need to use AI at all!\n",
    "2. You are welcome to use AI as a tool (e.g. automate something that is tedious, help you get unstuck, etc.). However, you should be coding, you should be thinking, you should be writing, you should be creating. If you are spending most (or even close to most) of your time typing into a chatbot and copy-pasting, you have probably gone too far with AI use.\n",
    "3. I don't find large volumes of AI generated code/text/plots to be particularly impressive and you risk losing my interest while grading. Remember: I'm grading your extensions based on your video presentation. **More is not necessarily better.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Video guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Please try to keep your video to 5 minutes (*I have other projects to grade!*). If you turn in a longer video, I make no promise that I will watch more than 5 minutes.\n",
    "2. Your screen should be shared as you show me what you did. A live video of your face should also appear somewhere on the screen (e.g. picture-in-picture overlay / split screen).\n",
    "3. Your partner should join you for the video and take turns talking, but, if necessary, it is fine to have one team member present during the record the video.\n",
    "4. Do not simply read text from your notebook, do not read from a prepared script. I am not grading how polished your video presentation is (see extension grading criteria on rubric). \n",
    "5. I am looking for original and creative explorations sparked by your curiosity/interest/passion in a topic. This should be apparent in your video.\n",
    "6. Be natural,, don't feel the need to impress me with fancy language. If it is helpful, imagine that we are talking one-on-one about your extension. Tell me what you did :)\n",
